# Breast Cancer Detection
In the breast cancer dataset, each datapoint has measurements from an image of a breast mass and whether or not itâ€™s cancerous. The goal will be to use these measurements to predict if the mass is cancerous.


# Fitting
While fitting the model, we get a Convergence Warning. This means that the model needs more time to find the optimal solution. One option is to increase the number of iterations. You can also switch to a different solver, which is what we will do. The solver is the algorithm that the model uses to find the equation of the line. A list of possible solvers can be found in the Logistic regression [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)# Breast_Cancer_detection
